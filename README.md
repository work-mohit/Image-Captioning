# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning is a deep learning based project which is deployed on web.
The details of the project is mentioned below with the relevant images.

You saw an image and your brain can easily tell what the image is about, but can a 
computer tell what the image is representing?
Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual 
description must be generated for a given photograph. It requires both methods from 
computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the 
field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in 
the right order.

Image caption generator is a task that involves computer vision and natural language 
processing concepts to recognize the context of an image and describe them in a natural 
language like English. Here are some objectives of this project :

● Encode images and their respective captions.
● Train a model to generate captions.
● Deploy the model as a web app so it can be used globally.
